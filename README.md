# RAG App: A Customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation Application

RAG App is a Python-based application designed to enhance natural language understanding by incorporating document retrieval capabilities. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer queries based on private and previously unseen document collections, enabling accurate and contextual responses.

## Features

- **Document Loading:** Seamlessly load and preprocess text documents for analysis.
- **Customizable Retrieval Parameters:** Supports tuning retrieval backends like FAISS, Milvus, or any compatible vector database.
- **Flexible Language Model Integration:** Use any Hugging Face-compatible language model for query generation.
- **Contextual Q&A:** Dynamically answers questions based solely on the loaded document's content.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aliosmankaya/rag-app.git
   cd rag-app
   ```
2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. **Query the Document:**
   - Load your document into the application.
   - Ask a query related to the document.
   - Receive a contextually relevant response.

## Configuration

- Modify `config.json` to adjust retrieval or generation parameters.
- Update `pyproject.toml` for dependency management.
